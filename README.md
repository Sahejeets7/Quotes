"I don't want it to have happened. I want it to not have happened, but if you are grateful for your life ... then you have to be grateful for all of it. You can't pick and choose what you're grateful for. So, what do you get from loss? You get awareness of other people's loss, which allows you to connect with that other person, which allows you to love more deeply and to understand what it's like to be a human being, if it's true that all humans suffer."

SUCCESS SIMPLIFIED
How A.I. Assistants Could Supercharge Workplace SoftwareCompanies from Monday.com to Microsoft expect A.I. assistants to make it easier to use their powerful platforms.
BY BEN SHERRY, STAFF REPORTER
@BENLUCASSHERRY

Keeping your workplace running smoothly and efficiently is one of your primary duties as a founder, but the actual work of managing and following up on projects can be time-consuming. Some companies are hoping that by integrating A.I.-powered assistants into their software, they can simplify complicated operations and give novice users access to advanced tools originally designed for experts. 

One such organization introducing an A.I. assistant is the workplace operations software platform Monday.com, which is used by brands like Coca-Cola, Hulu, and Glossier to plan out and organize projects, develop customized workflows, and track employee workloads. Monday is planning to integrate an A.I. assistant into its platform via a free update, powered with four new tools. Here's what they are and how they work: 

Automated task generation: Users will be able to create detailed project plans by describing what tasks need to get done in natural language. In a demo video shown to Inc., a user requests the A.I. assistant to create a group of all tasks needed to design a website, from sketches to handoff. The A.I. then created new tasks including early sketches, design review, final design, and usability testing. 

Composing and rephrasing emails: As part of Monday's sales CRM, the platform will introduce a tool that can be used to automatically write and rewrite emails. In the demo, the user tasks the A.I. assistant with crafting an email to introduce a new product and the A.I. quickly creates a message complete with relevant data and statistics. 

Summarizing: Monday's A.I. will also be able to analyze text documents and create brief summaries of key information. In the demo video, a user is shown summarizing their meeting notes into a few bullet points. 

Formula building: The final tool, which Monday says will be released at a later time, allows users to create formulas through natural language prompts, without needing any lessons. In the demo, the user asks the A.I. assistant to help with creating a formula to calculate the total estimated hours for a group of subtasks to be completed. 

Monday will also open up the platform for third-party developers to build A.I.-powered applications for more specific tasks. These applications can then be implemented by other users via the monday.com marketplace.

Monday's announcement comes roughly a month after Microsoft announced its own A.I. assistant, Copilot, which works across the 365 suite of apps including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. By using data from the entire suite, Copilot can do some pretty impressive things. Microsoft said that a manager could ask Copilot to "tell my team how we updated project strategy" and the chatbot will automatically generate a status update based on the morning's meetings, emails, and chat threads. 

It remains to be seen if these A.I. assistants will become a daily part of using workplace software, but their potential to unlock new levels of software functionality is already evident, so the chances are good that you'll be using them in your business sooner or later.
